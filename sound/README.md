# Sound Files for Troll Features

## Flashbang Audio

To enable the flashbang sound effect, place your `Flashbang.mp3` file in this directory.

### Requirements:
- **File name:** `Flashbang.mp3` (exactly this name)
- **Format:** MP3 audio file
- **Recommended duration:** 1-3 seconds
- **Volume:** The system will automatically set volume to 70%

### Suggested Sound Effects:
- Explosion sound
- Stun grenade audio
- Camera flash sound
- Any dramatic "boom" or "bang" effect

### File Structure:
```
sound/
├── Flashbang.mp3  ← Place your audio file here
└── README.md      ← This file
```

The flashbang feature will work without the audio file, but adding the sound makes it much more impactful! 💥
